# web-scraping-challenge

Keywords: web scraping, Flask, MongoDB, pandas, BeautifulSoup, Requests/Splinter, HTML, Python

In this excercise, I scraped various websites and newsfeeds for the latest information (text and images) on Mars. I then leveraged MongoDB, Flask, and HTML to create an interactive webpage that always displays the latest news and data on Mars when the user clicks for information on the planet.
